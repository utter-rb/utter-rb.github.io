	<h3>Philosophy</h3>
	Building a Microservice often requires the utilization of knowledge from a number of different domains.
	Utter's Domain-specific Microservices are source code artifacts that focus on a specific core domain, 
	while incorporating knowledge from other supporting, and generic domains, via extensions. 

	<dl>
	  <dt>
	  Everything is a Component
	  </dt>
	  Utter perceives a microservice project as a single service, a single domain, and a number of domain-extenstions.
	  The service could have a number of endpoints that are part of the whole system API in production when mounted.
	  The domain is an isolated bounded-context refined at well-balanced scale with respect to the whole system.
	  The objective of this domain isolation is to limit complexity of a solution, 
	  via providing the means for the domain-experts to engage in providing the solution.
	  The domain could have a Domain-specific language (DSL) that aids in attaining experts' aid in tackling the domain challenges.
	  Domain-extenstions are the means for incorportating knowledge from domains(supporting, generic) in a packagable manner.
	  Usually your system will be composed out of a number of microservices. Each of those microservices shall contain a service component, a domain component, and a number of domain extenstion components. 
	  Every component granularity is dictated via the role it acts, in relevance to the context in which it will be represented. 
<!--
	  <dt>
	  Everything is Usable 
	  </dt>
	  Utter generates context-aware system components, e.g. standalone microservices vs project embedded microservices.
	  The Utter way guides you into dividing your system into fine-grained components,
	  making sure that every system component you develop is simple enough to be understood by others, hence openly usable in a sharing culture.

	  <dt>
	  Everything is Reusable 
	  </dt>
	  Utter components are versioned packageable gems, meaning any utter component is one command away form being distributed to the community.
